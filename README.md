# VPlanner

Internal content-production dashboard. First module: long-form YouTube video
pipeline management.

## Stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router) — frontend and backend in one project
- **Supabase** — Postgres database, auth, and file storage. Permissions are
  enforced at the database level via Row Level Security (RLS), not just in
  the UI.
- **Vercel** — hosting. `main` branch → production. Every other branch/PR →
  its own preview deployment, pointed at the staging database.

## Project structure

```
app/
  login/                 Sign-in page (email/password, server action)
  (dashboard)/           Everything behind auth
    dashboard/           Placeholder home page
  api/auth/callback/     OAuth/magic-link callback (unused today, ready for
                          Google auth later)
lib/
  supabase/              Client helpers (browser, server, middleware)
  permissions/roles.ts   Frontend mirror of the DB's role → stage rules
modules/
  long-videos/           Where the video-pipeline module's own components
                          and logic will live, kept separate from shared
                          app code so future modules (Shorts, TikTok, etc.)
                          don't get tangled up with this one
supabase/
  migrations/0001_init.sql   Full schema: teams, roles, tags, projects,
                              stages, comments, review pins, RLS policies
types/database.ts        Placeholder types — see note below
```

## First-time setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Apply the database schema.** In your Supabase project (use
   `vplanner-staging` first): open the **SQL Editor**, paste the entire
   contents of `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`, and run it. Do the same
   in `vplanner-production` once you're happy with it.

3. **Set up local environment variables**
   ```
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Fill in `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   from your **staging** project (Settings → Data API). Never commit
   `.env.local` — it's already gitignored.

4. **Create your own login.** This app has no public sign-up page on
   purpose. Create your first user from the Supabase dashboard:
   Authentication → Users → Add user (set an email + password). That's the
   account you'll sign in with.

5. **Run it locally**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:3000`, sign in, and you should land on a bare
   dashboard confirming your session and database connection both work.

6. **(Optional, recommended) Generate real types once the schema is live**
   ```
   npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <your-project-ref> > types/database.ts
   ```

## Pushing this to GitHub

From inside this folder:

```
git init                        # only if not already a git repo
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/vplanner.git   # if not already set
git add .
git commit -m "Scaffold Next.js + Supabase project structure, auth, and DB schema"
git push -u origin main
```

Vercel will pick up the push automatically and deploy it.

## Where things stand

This is the **foundation**, not the finished app: real auth, a real
database schema with the full permission model enforced by RLS, and a
proof-that-it-all-works dashboard page. The actual VPlanner interface
(workspace switcher, project pipeline UI, calendar, editor review tool,
etc.) gets built next, on top of this — and on top of a proper design
system pass, since the current styling is placeholder only.


## Security model (read before adding features)

- **RLS is the real boundary.** Every table has Row Level Security. The UI
  hiding a button is convenience, never protection.
- **Users can only edit columns they genuinely own.** Since migration 0022,
  column-level grants restrict what a logged-in user can UPDATE (e.g. only
  `is_read` on notifications, never `owner_id` on teams, never anything on
  invites or ownership requests).
- **Admin client golden rule.** `createAdminClient()` bypasses RLS. Use it
  only in server actions, only after checking the caller is allowed, and
  only with values the user could NOT have edited themselves.
  `import "server-only"` makes the build fail if it ever reaches the browser.
- **Notifications are server-created only** — always via
  `sendNotifications()` in `lib/notify.ts`.
- **Never trust a teamId from the browser for a privileged action.** Derive
  the team from the row being acted on (see `requireProjectMaster`).
- **Database triggers enforce the invariants:** only a Master changes a
  project's stage; projects never change team; the owner can't be removed
  and is always Master; only the owner grants/removes Master.

## Migrations

Files in `supabase/migrations/` are run in order on BOTH Supabase projects
(staging first, then production). Personal one-off SQL goes in
`supabase/scratch/` (gitignored) — never in `migrations/`.

## Performance conventions (follow these for every new feature)

**Database**
- Every new column you filter, join or sort by gets an index in the same
  migration. Postgres does NOT index foreign keys automatically.
- Read (SELECT) policies check membership with the set helpers, never a
  per-row function: `team_id in (select my_team_ids())`,
  `project_id in (select my_project_ids())`,
  `recipient_id = (select auth.uid())`. The `(select …)` wrapper is what
  makes Postgres evaluate it once per query instead of once per row.
- Never write a single `FOR ALL` policy — split into insert / update /
  delete so reads don't pay for write checks.
- Select only the columns a screen needs; filter child rows in the query
  (e.g. only the open tab's comments), not in JavaScript afterwards.

**Server (pages & actions)**
- Independent queries go in ONE `Promise.all` — never `await` them one by
  one. Each sequential await is a full round trip to the database.
- Anything two places in the same request need (a project, the user, a
  membership) is wrapped in React `cache()` — see
  `modules/long-videos/lib/queries.ts` and `lib/supabase/get-user.ts`.
- `getCachedUser()` reuses the identity middleware already verified — no
  extra auth round trip. Security-sensitive server ACTIONS still call
  `supabase.auth.getUser()` themselves.
- Privileged data derives its team from the row itself (a project's
  `team_id`), not from the workspace switcher or the browser.

**Client**
- Call server actions through `useAction()` (`lib/hooks/use-action.ts`):
  consistent toasts, and an `optimistic` hook paired with React's
  `useOptimistic` so the UI responds instantly. Reference implementation:
  `videos/[id]/assignee-row.tsx`; notes use the same idea in
  `notes-panel.tsx`.
- Realtime handlers patch the exact rows that changed (see
  `notification-bell.tsx`) or debounce `router.refresh()` — never refresh
  the whole page per event, and skip events caused by your own action.
- Every route has a `loading.tsx` built from `components/ui/skeleton.tsx`.
  Same-page navigations (tabs) get `<LinkPendingIndicator />`.
- Images: upload through `compressImage()` with an `IMAGE_PRESETS` entry
  and `UPLOAD_CACHE_CONTROL`; render with `loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"`.

## UI conventions

- **Icons:** SVG components from `components/ui/icons.tsx` only. Never use
  Unicode symbols (▶ ✓ ★ 📅 …) for UI — iOS renders many as emoji.
- **Stage colors mean state, not identity:** `stageState()` +
  `STAGE_STATE_COLOR` (orange = current, teal = done, neutral = upcoming).
- **Popovers/overlays that must escape the header** render through a
  portal on `document.body` — the sticky header's `backdrop-blur` traps
  `position: fixed` children.
- **People link to profiles** via `profileHref()` / `MemberAvatarLink` /
  `MemberNameLink`; `/u/<username>` or `/u/<user-id>` both work.
- **Roles next to a name:** `<RolePills roles={…} />` (max 2 + "+N").

## Search

`global_search()` (migration 0024) is the single search backend. It is
SECURITY INVOKER on purpose: RLS decides what anyone can find, so never
convert it to SECURITY DEFINER. To make something new searchable, add a
trigram index on `lower(column)` and a new section to the function, then a
section in `components/search/global-search.tsx`.

## Short videos

Stages: Script → Editing → In review → Ready to post → Posted. "Posted" is
never set by hand — it follows `short_video_posts` (all planned platforms
marked = Posted). Who may change which field is decided by the
`short_guard_update` trigger (migration 0026); `modules/short-videos/lib/permissions.ts`
mirrors it for the UI. History (`short_video_events`) is written only by
triggers. Entry numbers come from `next_team_number()` — never set them
from the app.

### Shorts scheduling queue (0027)
Auto-dated shorts are never dated by the app: the database re-dates them
(`recalc_short_queue`) whenever something that affects the schedule
changes. The app only ever sets `planned_date` (= pin) or
`schedule_mode = 'auto'` (= back to the queue), and reorders through the
`move_short()` RPC.
